## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Tailwindcss for the styles
- CSS Flexbox based layout
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

With this simple project I've tried to dive deeper in Tailwindcss and really learn how to set up a Tailwindcss project. I reinforced my knowledge and sklls to build responsive layouts using CSS features like flexbox. Also I learned how to setup custom utilitie classes in Tailwindcss to use custom fonts and custom screen sizes for the responsiveness of the design.

Inside the _**tailwind.config.js**_ file in the root directory of the project this is done in the following lines of code

```js
  fontFamily: {
				Montserrat: ["Montserrat", "sans-serif"],
				Fraunces: ["Fraunces", "serif"],
			},
	screens: {
				"-lg": { max: "1023px" },
			},
```

### Continued development

The skill to bring a .jpeg to a web page exactly as it is in the image is the main focus of my future training and studies. I need to train the designer eye aswell as the developer eye. Also I need to go deeper the path of using Tailwindcss as my main tool to style and create responsive layouts.
